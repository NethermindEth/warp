# Warp

Warp brings EVM compatible languages to StarkNet, making it possible to transpile Ethereum smart contracts to Cairo, and use them on StarkNet.

## Installation :gear:

You'll need to install Cairo first. Make sure you're using a python venv with python 3.7. Cairo depends on GMP, which can be installed with `sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev` or `brew install gmp` if you're on Mac. You'll need to install the following too:

```
pip install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
```

Once you've done that, head into vendor/cairo-lang and run:

```
sh build.sh
pip install cairo-lang-0.3.0.zip
```

Once that is finished, run `make warp` in the project repo's root directory.

## Usage :computer:

You can transpile your Solidity/Vyper contracts with:

```
warp transpile CONTRACT
```

To deploy the transpiled Cairo contract to Starknet use:
```
warp deploy CONTRACT.cairo
```

To invoke a public/external method use:
```
warp invoke --contract CONTRACT.cairo --address ADDRESS --function FUNCTION_NAME --inputs "INPUTS"
```

The `--inputs` flag requires its argument to be a string and have each value separated by a space.

You can check the status of your transaction with:

```
warp status TX_ID
```
