Version 1.0 dated December 22, 2020

This license contains the terms and conditions under which StarkWare
Industries, Ltd ("StarkWare") makes available its Cairo Toolchain
("Toolchain"). Your use of the Toolchain is subject to these terms and
conditions.

StarkWare grants you ("Licensee") a license to use the Toolchain, only
for the purpose of developing and compiling Cairo programs. Licensee's
use of the Toolchain is limited to non-commercial use, which means academic,
scientific, or research and development use, or evaluating the Cairo
language and Toolchain.

StarkWare grants Licensee a license to modify the Toolchain, only as
necessary to fix errors. Licensee may, but is not obligated to, provide
any of Licensee's modifications to StarkWare. This license grants Licensee no
right to distribute the Toolchain or make copies of the Toolchain available
to others.

These terms do not allow Licensee to sublicense or transfer any of Licensee's
rights to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses not
expressly granted in this license.

If Licensee violates any of these terms, or uses the Toolchain in a way not
authorized under this license, the license granted to Licensee ends immediately.
If Licensee makes, or authorizes any other person to make, any written claim
that the Toolchain infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, all
rights granted to Licensee under this license end immediately.

As far as the law allows, the Toolchain is provided AS IS, without any warranty
or condition, and StarkWare will not be liable to Licensee for any damages
arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the Toolchain, under any kind
of legal claim.
