Cairo Program License (Source Available)

Version 1.0, November 2020

This license contains the terms and conditions under which StarkWare
Industries, Ltd ("StarkWare") makes available its StarkEx Cairo Software
("Cairo Software"). Your use of the Cairo Software is subject to these
terms and conditions.

StarkWare grants you a license to use and distribute the Cairo Software
during the Test Period, only for writing Cairo programs. The Cairo Verifier
Smart Contract ("Verifier") is not part of the Cairo Software and is
subject to a separate license. The "Test Period" will end on June 30, 2021,
however, StarkWare may extend this date by posting a notice of extension
referencing this license on its web site
https://www.starkware.co/source-available-license/.

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your rights to
anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses not expressly
granted in this license.

If you violate any of these terms, use the Cairo Software in a way not
authorized under this license, your license ends immediately. If you make,
or authorize any other person to make, any written claim that the Cairo
Software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, all rights
you are granted under this license end immediately. In either case, for
purposes of your license, the Test Period will end.

After the end of the Test Period, you will not be licensed to use the Cairo
Software to write Cairo programs, but you may retain and distribute copies of
the Cairo Software only as needed to allow Ethereum nodes to sync with the
Ethereum Mainnet and verify Ethereum transactions.

As far as the law allows, the Cairo Software is provided AS IS, without any
warranty or condition, and StarkWare will not be liable to you for any damages
arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the Cairo Software and/or
the Verifier, under any kind of legal claim.
