# An helper function to extract selected_ptrs from all_ptrs according to the builtin encodings
# that appear in the selected_encodings list.
# The caller needs to pass n_selected_builtins as a hint.
# Returns a pointer to the next memory slot after the selected_encodings list, see "Assumptions".
#
# For example, given the following setup:
#   - all_encodings points to ["output", "pedersen", "range-check"].
#   - selected_encodings points to ["output", "range-check"]
#   - all_ptrs points to [output_ptr, pedersen_ptr, range_check_ptr]
#   - The caller asserts that the return value is selected_encodings + n_selected_builtins(2).
# The function will check that selected_encodings points to [output_ptr, range_check_ptr].
#
# n_builtins is the length of the list of *all pointers*.
# Assumptions:
# * The caller has to check that n_selected_builtins = selected_encodings_end - selected_encodings.
# * All lists are sorted according to the order of builtins input in Cairo programs.
# * len(selected_encodings) <= len(all_encodings) == len(all_ptrs).
