<!-- Juno is a node which aims to help **decentralise StarkNet, a prominent Ethereum Layer 2**.

For its mission to be achieved, it needs people to **start running their own node**.

To become one of the early few making StarkNet better, read below.

### Disclaimer

In this short article we lay out the steps to get a Raspberry PI with a working [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/)
installation to run the Juno StarkNet node. We assume that you have access as a root user to the Pi.

At time of writing, **both StarkNet and Juno are still in an early release**. Expect this guide and required steps to change often!

For the latest on the project, check out our [Github repo](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno), and refer to our
[Documentation](https://gojuno.xyz/).

The disk space issues are currently work in progress, and will be addressed in an upcoming new release.

## Main Features

- [Get and Sync state from Layer 1](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/sync) (Ethereum).
- [Get and Sync state from API](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/sync) (Feeder Gateway).
- Store [StarkNet State](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/sync) locally.
- Store StarkNet Transactions.
- Store StarkNet Blocks.
- Store the ABI of StarkNet contracts.
- Ethereum-like [Json RPC Server](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/rpc) following
  [this spec](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/blob/master/api/starknet_api_openrpc.json).
  in the same way you would call the feeder gateway, where using the same params will return the same response.
- [CLI](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/cli) for general StarkNet tools.
- [Metrics](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/features/metrics) using Prometheus.

## Installation

### Specification 🤖

    - Raspberry 4 (model B) - 4GB
    - MicroSD card - 16GB+ (Class 10 Minimum)
    - Power supply
    - Internet connection (ethernet preferrable)
    - USB keyboard, a monitor, and an HDMI cable to interact with the computer or .

    - [Install Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/)
    - [Install Golang (see below)](https://golang.org/doc/install)
    - [Have make installed](https://golang.org/doc/install#make)

### Get Golang 🦫

Ensure that your Raspberry Pi is up-to-date.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Check the [Golang download website](https://go.dev/dl/) for the latest armv6l version. At time of writing, we would download go 1.18.3.

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.18.3.linux-armv6l.tar.gz -O go.tar.gz
```

Now extract the tarball into your /usr/local/ directory (root access required).

```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go.tar.gz
```

Add the following to your shell config (usually ~/.bashrc).
If you have no preferred text editor, you can use `nano ~/.bashrc` to edit your bash config from the terminal.

```bash
# ~/.bashrc
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Afterwards press `CTRL` + `X` and then `Y` to exit the nano text editor and save the file.

Finally, as your `.bashrc` is only initialised when the shell is started, you need to source the new `~/.bashrc` to update available commands.

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

You should now have a working Golang installation in your Raspberry Pi. You can check it typing:

```bash
go version
```

### Install Juno ⚙️

To install `juno`, the StarkNet node:

```bash
go install github.com/NethermindEth/juno/cmd/juno@latest
```

To install `juno-cli`, the separate tool for interacting with StarkNet:

```bash
go install github.com/NethermindEth/juno/cmd/juno-cli@latest
```

For details about the configuration you can look at
the [config file description](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/running/config).

## Configuring juno

Usually, when you first run Juno, a [config file](https://gojuno.xyz/docs/running/config) will be created in
`/home/pi/.config/juno/juno.yaml` in your home directory.

When syncing the StarkNet state from a Raspberry Pi, we expect you to have at least 64GB. In case of you don't have
this space, you can run it using an SSD, ensuring that the property `db_path` points to the external SSD:

```yaml
# juno.yaml
db_path: /path/to/ssd/database/here
``` -->
