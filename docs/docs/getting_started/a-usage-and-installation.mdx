## Installation

> **Note:**
> The page refers to warp for cairo 0. If you are looking for cairo 1 warp see [installing from source](https://nethermindeth.github.io/warp/docs/contribution_guidelines/a-installing-from-source).

### Dependencies

1. You will need [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) and [gmp](https://gmplib.org/#DOWNLOAD)
   installed to use Warp.

- Install command on macOS:

```bash
brew install z3 gmp
```

If you're on an arm based Apple machine (m1/m2 mac) you'll need to install `gmp` and export some
environment variables

```
export CFLAGS=-I`brew --prefix gmp`/include
export LDFLAGS=-L`brew --prefix gmp`/lib
```

- Install command on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libz3-dev libgmp3-dev
```

2. Install Python3.9 with dev dependencies (`python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev`) into your base env.
   If you do not have the dev dependencies installed the installation will fail.

- Install commands on MacOS:

```bash
brew install python@3.9
```

With python3.9 already installed you have venv covered:

> If you are using Python 3.3 or newer (...) venv is included in the Python standard library and requires no additional installation.

Then you can install dev package using pip:

```bash
pip install python-dev-tools
```

- Install commands on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev
```

Or you can just install python3.9 and then install python-dev-tools using pip.

3. Install Python dependencies. You can find them in requirements.txt file in repository:
   [https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp/blob/develop/requirements.txt](https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp/blob/develop/requirements.txt). You can install them via `pip3.9 install <package-name>` command.

Note: It is important to install dependencies for Python 3.9, not for any other version of Python you may have installed on your machine.

### Installation

The first step is to make sure you have all required external [dependencies](#dependencies) installed.

Then perform the following instructions in order:

1. Add the warp package from npm.

```bash
yarn global add @nethermindeth/warp
```

2. Ensure the package was added by checking the version number:

```bash
warp version
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
warp install --verbose
```

Use the `--python` flag to pass the path to `python3.9` binary, if the above command complains.

```bash
warp install --python <path/to/python3.9> --verbose
```

4. Test the installation worked by transpiling an example ERC20 contract:

```bash
warp transpile <contract-path>
```
