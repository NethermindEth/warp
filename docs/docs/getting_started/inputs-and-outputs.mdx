## Inputs

The transpiled Cairo contracts have a different ABI than their Solidity counterparts. Warp allows the use of either
the Cairo ABI or the Solidity ABI for passing constructor arguments or function parameters. By default, the Solidity ABI
is used.

Following examples demonstrate how to use both methods

### Using Solidity ABI

After transpiling the OpenZepplin ERC20 contract, we need to pass two strings to the constructor that
represent the name and ticker of the token. It can be deployed using Warp as follows:

```
warp deploy warp_output/ERC20__WC__ERC20.cairo --inputs \"NETHERCOIN\",\"NETH\"
```

For using the Solidity ABI to pass inputs, they must be passed as a comma separated list of numbers, strings and lists.
For example:

```
\"NETHERCOIN\",10,\[10,5,4,2\]
```

The above comma separated list passes three parameters as a string, number and list respectively.

### Using Cairo ABI

To use the cairo ABI for passing inputs, the `--use_cairo_abi` flag can be passed to the `deploy`, `invoke` or `call` command.
Starknet does not support Solidity-style strings. So Warp represents strings as dynamic arrays of bytes. In Cairo ABI, each solidity
string is represented in two parts, the length of the string, and the value of each byte.
In the same example of OpenZepplin's ERC20, the two strings can be passed as follows using Cairo ABI:

```
warp deploy warp_output/ERC20__WC__ERC20.cairo --use_cairo_abi --inputs  10,0x4e,0x45,0x54,0x48,0x45,0x52,0x43,0x4f,0x49,0x4e,4,0x4e,0x45,0x54,0x48
```

When using `--use_cairo_abi`, negative numbers must be passed in the 2's complement form.
`uint256` and `int256` types are converted into (low, high) in the Cairo ABI.

The following table represents the ABI for each type in both Solidity in Cairo.

## Outputs

The output received from functions are in the form of the types supported by the transpiled Cairo contracts.
For example, a `uint256` value is retured as `{low, high}`, while a string is returned as the number of characters in the string
and their ASCII values.

The following Solidity contract named example.sol will be used to illustrate the feature:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8;

contract foo {
  uint256 public x;

  string public y;

  constructor(uint256 _x, string memory _y) {
    x = _x;
    y = _y;
  }
}
```

Transpile the contract:

```
warp transpile example.sol
```

Deploy the contract:

```
warp deploy warp_output/example__WC__foo.cairo --inputs 5,\"test\"
```

`call` the contract to get the outputs:

```
$: warp call warp_output/example__WC__foo.cairo --function x --address 0x01563072fb9a5ce43c5610d205dd815051714d9949104db009a0bbd3ff71c75f
5 0

$: warp call warp_output/example__WC__foo.cairo --function y --address 0x01563072fb9a5ce43c5610d205dd815051714d9949104db009a0bbd3ff71c75f
4 116 101 115 116
```
