title: Addresses
---

Addresses on Starknet are larger than on Ethereum.
On Starknet they take up the whole felt space (251 bits) rather than 160 bits.

To support StarkNet addresses we have slightly modified the solc compiler.
As a result, addresses in our flavour of Solidity are represented with 256 bits instead of 160 bits.

It is also important to note that the `ecrecover` precompile will not work with StarkNet addresses,
only Ethereum addresses. Hence, it will return a uint160 and not an address.
