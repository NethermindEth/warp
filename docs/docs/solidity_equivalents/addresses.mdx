title: Addresses

Addresses on Starknet are longer than on Ethereum. On Starknet they take up the whole felt space i.e 251 bits.
This is significantly longer than the Ethereum equivalent of 160 bits.

Please note that the precompile `ecrecover` should be used to recover Ethereum addresses only and not StarkNet addresses.
This function will only return 160 bits.
