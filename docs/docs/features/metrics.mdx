# Important Metrics

The important metrics that have been covered are as follows:

1. `no_of_requests` - This metric provides the number of requests that have been sent to and received from the `feeder` gateway. This metric not only shows the total number of requests but also depicts the number of requests for each type (for example - `get_contract_addresses` or `get_block`). In addition, this metric also stores the number of failures (if any) that occurred while making requests.

2. `no_of_abi` - This metric stores the number of ABI requests sent to and received from the feeder gateway. This also stores the number of failures (if any).

3. `count_starknet_sync` - This metric stores the number of times Juno succeeds and fails in updating and committing blocks for syncing with Starknet.

4. `time_starknet_sync` - This metric stores the total and average time needed for updating and committing blocks for syncing with Starknet. --> -->
