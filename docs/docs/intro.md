# Welcome to Warp

Let's discover **Warp in less than 5 minutes**.

## Work in Progress

<!-- - [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) version 1.18 for build and run the project.
- _For Linux_: You will need to install `clang`:

```shell
sudo apt -y install clang
```

### Installing

After cloning the project,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno
```

You can install all the dependencies running the next command inside the project folder:

```bash
$ go get ./...
```

## Running Juno

### Compiling Directly

Compile Juno:

```bash
$ make compile
```

After compilation, you will have 2 commands inside the `build` folder of the project:

- juno
  - `juno` is the command that initialize the node
- juno-cli
  - `juno-cli` is the command that handle a set of different commands about the StarkNet ecosystem.

```bash
$ make run
```

For more details on the configuration, check the [config description](./running/config.mdx).
