# description: How formatting the files of the app

<!--
For formatting we are using [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt), a more strict gofmt.

To install `gofumpt`, you can run the next command:

```bash
make install-gofumpt
```

Then, to format your code you can use:

```bash
make format
```

For most of the common editors like [vim](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#vim-go),
[golang](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#goland), or
[vscode](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt#visual-studio-code), there exists a way to set your editor to format
using `gofumpt`, see the links for more details. -->
