title: Implementation & testing
---

> **Note:**
> If you are using docker compose for development all commands have to be run within `warp` container.

It can be tedious to manually recompile the project after every minor change. You can automate the process of recompiling by executing the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Alternatively to `yarn dev` you can run typescript in interpreted mode to achieve the same. This is an example using `transpile` command:

```bash
npx ts-node src transpile example_contracts/ERC20.sol
```

To start developing warp you can pick a task from [project issues](https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp/issues).

## Testing :stethoscope:

Once you've implemented a change you have to test it. Warp includes three sets of tests:

- Compilation Tests: These tests ensure that transpiled contracts are valid Cairo code.

- Behaviour Tests: These tests verify the correct functionality of transpiled contracts.

- Semantic Tests: These tests involve transpiling Solidity's semantic tests and checking that the runtime behaviour remains consistent.

### Cairo 1

Cairo 1 warp currently supports compilation and behaviour tests only.

#### Compilation Tests

Start by running the compilation tests to verify that your contribution doesn't break any fundamental features. These tests are also the quickest to execute.

```bash
yarn test:compilation
```

#### Behaviour Tests

Behaviour tests involve transpiling a set of Solidity contracts and deploying them to a testnet. Each deployed contract undergoes testing for all of its runtime functionality.

##### Docker compose

Within `warp` container run:

```bash
yarn test:behaviour
```

##### Manual setup

1. First load environment variables from [development.env](https://github.com/NethermindEth/warp/blob/cairo-1-docs/development.env):

```bash
set -o allexport && source development.env && set +o allexport
```

2. Run devnet:

```bash
starknet-devnet &
```

3. Run behaviour tests:

```bash
yarn test:behaviour
```

### Cairo 0

1. Run the setup script (Required only once):

```bash
tests/behaviour/setup.sh
```

2. In a separate terminal, start a StarkNet testnet server (make sure cairo-lang is installed in the environment):

```bash
yarn testnet
```

3. Run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

To generate benchmarks locally during development:

```bash
yarn testnet:benchmark
yarn test
```

```python
python starknet-testnet/generateMarkdown.py
```

This saves the benchmarks at `benchmark/stats/data.md`

#### Semantic Tests

Semantic tests involve transpiling each of Solidity's behaviour tests and deploying them. Each test is executed, and its result is compared to the output of its Solidity counterpart.

Execute instructions _1_ and _2_ from [Behaviour Tests](#behaviour-tests) if you haven't already. Then:

3. Run semantic tests:

```bash
yarn test:semantic
```
