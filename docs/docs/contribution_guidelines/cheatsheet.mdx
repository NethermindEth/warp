## Page Title & Data

For the title of the page, and the name of the tab, at the very top of your file, add this code snippet at the top.

Anything inbetween the `---` tags will be used for the page meta data.

```md
---
title: Cheatsheet
id: page-id-when-linking-to-it
---
```

For Heading 1 specifically, you should set the page title in the meta data.

## Codeblocks

Define a section using ` ``` `. Anything between two lines that contain these 3 back quotes will be in a code block.

To get syntax highlighting and formatting for a certain language succh as Javascript:

```js
const threeCats = ['cat', 'cat', 'cat'];
```

````md
Mind indentation here, code blocks in code blocks is not standard
`js const threeCats = ["cat", "cat", "cat"] `
````

There are many different formattings to use, `md`, `js`, `ts`, etc. The package used to render [Prism react render](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)

## Links

The links in this paragraph are being pulled from a list [a link][1] and
another [link][2].

```md

another [link][2].
```

```md
This is that list

[1]: http://example.com/ 'Title'
[2]: http://example.org/ 'Title'
```

[1]: http://example.com/ 'Title'
[2]: http://example.org/ 'Title'

## Images

### Alt tags for images

You can update the alt tag data for text like this:

Logo: ![Alt](/img/logo.png 'Juno logo')

```md
Logo: ![Alt](/img/logo.png 'Juno logo')
```

You can create a image with a hyperlink to another page or a hash link on the page by adding the link in the brackets next to it.

Linked logo: [![alt text](//img/logo.png)](https://docs.juno.io/ 'Off to the docs')

```md
Linked logo: [![alt text](//img/logo.png)](https://docs.juno.io/ 'Off to the docs')
```

## MDX features

A quick note on using what's called `.mdx` features, `mdx` means markdown extended, to used these features, you need to name your file to have the extention `.mdx`

For example `cheatsheet.mdx`

This lets you use react components that are a bit more intricate that the standard markdown features.

To make use of an `mdx` component like `Tabs`, you need to add any `import ... from ...` lines to the top of the page, but below the meta data section. Heres an example:

```
---
title: Cheatsheet (Heading 1)
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

### Tabs

This is an example of the `tabs` component.

For extend usage, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/tabs)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="apple"
  values={[
    { label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' },
    { label: 'Orange', value: 'orange' },
    { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="apple">This is an apple üçé</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange">This is an orange üçä</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana">This is a banana üçå</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```mdx
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="apple"
  values={[
    { label: 'Apple', value: 'apple' },
    { label: 'Orange', value: 'orange' },
    { label: 'Banana', value: 'banana' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="apple">This is an apple üçé</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange">This is an orange üçä</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana">This is a banana üçå</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Inline Table of Contents

If you need a table contents literally anywhere, you can make use of the `<TOCInline>` component.

For extend usage, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc)

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

```mdx
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} />
```

## Footnotes & references

This is how we make a reference to a foot note or reference that's found at the bottoms of the page.[^1]

```md
This is how we make a reference to a footnote [^1] that's found at the bottoms of the page
```

To create list of foot notes, you just add list like this somewhere, preferably at the bottom of the file

```md
[^1]: an amazing foot note, you can add links n things here as usual
```

[^1]: an amazing foot note, you can add links n things here as usual
