title: Setuping development environment
---

Development environment may be setup manually or via docker-compose.

## Docker

> **Note:**
> Executing Warp using Docker works only for x86 architecture. If you're using ARM architecture (such as Apple's M1) you can find warp installation instructions [here](https://nethermindeth.github.io/warp/docs/getting_started/a-usage-and-installation).

1. Clone repository and `cd warp/`
2. Build docker containers:
```
docker-compose up
```
3. Install javascript dependencies :
```
docker-compose exec warp yarn
```
4. Compile the project:
```
docker-compose exec warp yarn build
```
5. Build warplib:
```
docker-compose exec warp yarn warplib
```
6. Test the installation worked by transpiling an example ERC20 contract:
```
bin/warp transpile exampleContracts/ERC20.sol
```

## Manually

First, please make sure you have all the required external [dependencies](https://nethermindeth.github.io/warp/docs/getting_started/a-usage-and-installation#dependencies) installed.

Then, with a Python3.9 virtual environment activated, perform the following instructions:

1. Clone this repo and change directory into the `warp` folder.

2. Install the JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

3. Install the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using a M1 chipped Mac and getting a `'gmp.h' file not found` error when installing Cairo run the following:

```bash
CFLAGS=-I`brew --prefix gmp`/include LDFLAGS=-L`brew --prefix gmp`/lib pip install ecdsa fastecdsa sympy
```

Then run the pip command above again.

4. Compile the project:

```bash
yarn build
```

5. Compile Warp libraries

```bash
yarn warplib
```

6. Test the installation worked by transpiling an example ERC20 contract:

```bash
bin/warp transpile exampleContracts/ERC20.sol
```
