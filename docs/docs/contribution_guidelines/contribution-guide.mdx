## Coming Soon(WIP)

<!-- Thank you for your interest in adding to our docs!

## Repo structure

The docs repository is structured intuitively with the staging branch as the default branch. Once you click on docs [(docs/docs)](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/docs/tree/staging/docs), you access a collection of .mds documents organized in folders the same way they are organized in the sidebar of the docs website.

- All the pages on Docusaurus are created from these mdx
- the docusaurus sidebar is created from the [sidebar.js](https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/blob/main/docs/sidebars.js) file

## Cheatsheet

We've created a simple cheatsheet file with examples of every heading, code block & tab component you can use to create your doc entry.

[Click here to see the reference doc](cheatsheet)

## Contribution steps:

**Step 1:** Create a branch off of the staging branch

**Step 2:** Add desired changes to your branch

- you can use yarn to visualize your edits locally using `yarn start`

**Step 3:** Make a PR to the main branch

- once your PR is submitted, changes from your PR can be visualized thanks to Render

**Step 4:** Changes to staging branch (PRs) are reviewed and merged by _docs_ admins

- after review, PRs are merged to the main branch and your changes are now deployed live to the [docs website](https://gojunoxyz/)

## Docusaurus-specific considerations

There's a couple things to be aware of when adding your own `*.md` files to our codebase:

- Please remove all `HTML` elements
- Links are done using `[text](link)`. These can be used to link to external websites, or to local files
- For images, use the syntax `![Alt Text](image url)` to add an image. For an acceptable alternative syntax see below:

```md
<img
src={require('../static/img/example-banner.png').default}
alt="Example banner"
/>
```

### Adding meta data to your doc

The docs make use of a feature called [frontmatter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter) which allows for the addition of some meta data and
controls the way docs are referenced through the site.

To correctly use it, add a small section at the top of your doc, such as:

```md
---
title: Example Doc
---
```

That title in the example will automatically add a `# Heading` to your page when it renders

There are a couple settings available;

Such as specifying the url you would like using

`slug: /questionably/deep/url/for/no/reason/buckwheat-crepes`

Adding `keywords` or `description` etc, as required. Full example:

```
---
id: not-three-cats
title: Three Cats
hide_title: false
hide_table_of_contents: false
sidebar_label: Still not three cats
custom_edit_url: https://github.com/NethermindEth/juno/docs/edit/main/docs/three-cats.md
description: Three cats are not unlike four cats like three cats
keywords:
  - cats
  - three
image: ./assets/img/logo.png
slug: /myDoc
---
My Document Markdown content
```

### Side bar navigation

To update the high level navigation, open the file in `docs/sidebars.js` and arrange n order as required. The titles for links are pulled from their files.

The `items` here take a page ID, a page ID by default is the title of the file, as example `example-doc.md` would be `example-doc`.
