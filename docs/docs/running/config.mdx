## Work in Progress

<!-- # Change config once created:

To quickly edit the configuration file, you can use the following command:

```
./build/juno configure
```

Which will open a Terminal User Interface displaying your current configuration values and allowing you to change them.

# About juno.yaml

The config file for `Juno` represents all settings needed to handle all supported functionalities for
node execution.

The basic structure is:

```yaml
logger:
  verbosity_level: 'debug'
  enable_json_output: true
ethereum:
  node: 'you_node_here'
rpc:
  enabled: false
  port: 8080
rest:
  enabled: false
  port: 8100
  prefix: /feeder_gateway
metrics:
  enabled: true
  port: 8100
db_path: /path/to/database
starknet:
  enabled: true
  feeder_gateway: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io
  api_sync: true
  network: mainnet
```

## Params

### logger

- `verbosity_level`: set the verbosity level of the node. Accepted values are an extension of zapcore.Level (debug, info, warn, error, dpanic, panic, fatal).
- `enable_json_output`: enable the log output to be in JSON format.

### ethereum

Configuration of the Ethereum node.

- `node`: put the address to an archive node, for example, an Infura archive node.

### rpc

Configuration of the RPC server.

- `enabled`: Whether the RPC server is enabled.
- `port`: The node in which the RPC server is going to be served.

### rest

Configuration for the REST server that handles all the feeder_gateway methods like http requests.

- `enabled`: Whether the REST server is enabled.
- `port`: Node in which the REST server is going to be served.
- `prefix`: Prefix fot the service, it should be: `node_ip:port/feeder_gateway`.

### metrics

Configuration for Prometheus metrics.

- `enabled`: Whether metrics are enabled.
- `port`: The node in which metrics are going to be served.

### db_path

Represents the path in which the data of the node is going to be saved.

### starknet

Represent the configuration for the StarkNet network and sync details.

- `enabled`: Represent if the REST server is enabled.
- `feeder_gateway`: Represent the StarkNet endpoint that we are going to connect, should be from another `Juno` node or
  from the feeder gateway, that defines mainnet or goerli, if `enabled` starknet, always needed.
- `api_sync`: To declare if synchronization is with the Feeder Gateway, or we are syncing against Layer 1.
- `network`: Used in case you don't have an ethereum node and want to do an API sync. By default, `mainnet` is the
  value, anything else will be considered as goerli. Not needed if you aren't running an API sync. -->
