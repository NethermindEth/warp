# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
This website template is also copied from [Flashbots Docs](https://github.com/flashbots/docs).

## Prerequisites

Before working on the documentation, follow the links below to install the developer dependencies.

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)

Once you have installed the above, ensure you're using the proper node version:

```shell
nvm use
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

That's it! You're ready to start contributing to Juno's documentation.

## Local Development

To start a local development server and open the site in a browser tab, run the command below.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```shell
yarn start
```

To build the project without starting a server or openning the site:

```shell
yarn build
```
