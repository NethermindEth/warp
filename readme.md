# Warp

Warp brings Solidity to StarkNet, making it possible to transpile Ethereum
smart contracts to StarkNet Cairo Contracts.

## Quickstart

Docker compose provides a ready to use environment featuring warp and devnet.

> **Note:**
> Execute Warp using Docker works only for x86 architecture, x64 architectures will be supported soon.

### Build and run containers

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Transpile

```bash
docker-compose exec warp warp transpile example_contracts/ERC20.sol
```

It's best to copy the contract/repo to the warp directory so it is available in container via volume. Use contract's paths relative to warp root. For example, assuming you've copied your project to `warp/projects/myproject` you can replace `example_contracts/ERC20.sol` with `projects/myproject/mycontract.sol` in the above command.

### Deploy to devnet

```bash
docker-compose exec warp warp compile warp_output/example__contracts/ERC20__WC__WARP.cairo
docker-compose exec warp starknet deploy --no_wallet --contract warp_output/example__contracts/ERC20__WC__WARP_compiled.json --gateway_url http://devnet:5050
```

## Documentation ðŸ“–

You can read the documentation [here](https://nethermindeth.github.io/warp/).

## Installation :gear:

You can install warp in one of two methods, read more about it [here](installation.md)

## Usage :computer:

If you have used installation method 1 you can use the `warp` command in any folder. If you have used installation method 2, you will have to specify the path to the warp directory followed by `bin/warp` e.g `path_to_warp_repo/bin/warp ...`

### StarkNet setup

Select your network and wallet types. It's recommended to set these as
environment variables but they can also be passed as explicit arguments to the
Warp CLI and the StarkNet CLI.

```
export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount
export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli
```

Make sure you have a StarkNet account set up, if you have not done so yet
please:

```
warp deploy_account
```

### CLI Commands

<hr> 
To transpile a Solidity contract:

```bash
warp transpile <path to Solidity contract>
```

To declare a StarkNet contract:

```bash
warp declare <path to StarkNet contract>
```

_Please note to deploy a contract you will first have to declare it._

To deploy a StarkNet contract:

```bash
warp deploy <path to StarkNet contract>
```

The deploy command will generate the compiled json file as well as the abi json
file. Use `warp deploy --help` command to see more deployment options.

### Libraries

<hr>
Libraries are bundled into the point of use, therefore if you try transpile a standalone library it will result in no output. If you would like to transpile and deploy a standalone library please alter its declaration to `contract`.

<br>

### Unsupported Solidity Features

<hr>
Several features of Solidity are not supported/do not have analogs in Starknet yet.
We will try our best to add these features as StarkNet supports them, but some may not be
possible due to fundamental differences in the platforms.

Please see the list below:

|           Support Status            |      Symbol       |

|              nested tuple assignments               |    :question:     |

Note: We have changed the return of `ecrecover` to be `uint160` because we use the `address` type for StarkNet addresses.

## Docker :whale:

> **Note:**
> Execute Warp using Docker works only for x86 architecture, x64 architectures will be supported soon.

Build the image from source:

```bash
docker build -t warp .
```

Run the container with the same options and arguments as the Warp binary:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/dapp --user $(id -u):$(id -g) warp transpile example_contracts/ERC20.sol
```
